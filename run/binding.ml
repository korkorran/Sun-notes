(* Everything the page can ask the native side to do.

   The handlers run on the Lwt event loop rather than on the UI thread. That
   matters here because all of them touch the filesystem: on the UI thread a
   slow disk, a network mount or a large file freezes the window for as long as
   the call takes, and several calls queue up behind each other. On the Lwt
   loop they interleave, and the window keeps drawing while they wait.

   Two event loops are in play. [Webview.run] keeps the process's main thread —
   Cocoa insists on it — and [Lwt_main.run] gets a thread of its own; see
   main.ml. [lwt_bind] below is the hop between the two. *)

(* Tracing, silent unless SUN_NOTES_DEBUG is set in the environment.

   These lines used to print on every call. On Windows that meant a console
   window filling up with file paths, and since the executable is now linked as
   a graphical program (see run/dune) there is no standard output to print to
   when it is launched from Explorer anyway.

   They are silenced rather than deleted because the sequence they show is what
   located the garbage-collector crash a binding call used to provoke: seeing
   read_dir answer and then the process die narrowed it down faster than
   anything else. Set SUN_NOTES_DEBUG and start the app from a terminal to get
   them back.

   [Printf.ifprintf] consumes the same arguments and discards them, so the call
   sites read as before and their formats are still type-checked. *)

   once. [run_in_main] moves that start onto the thread running [Lwt_main.run],
   the only one allowed to touch the Lwt scheduler, and [Lwt.async] leaves it to
   finish on its own — the answer travels back later through [Webview.return],
