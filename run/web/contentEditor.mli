(** The content pane in the right column.

    The editor holds several files at once, one tab each, and owns everything
    about them: what they contain, whether they are being viewed or edited,
    whether they differ from the disk, and what became of their last save. It
    writes them back itself — [write_file] is its call — so the application
    never has to know when a save happens or how it went.

    Tabs, messages and save statuses stay private: the application wraps [msg]
    on the way up and never inspects it. *)

val init : model
(** No file open. The pane says so until it is handed one. *)

val open_file : model -> path:string -> contents:string -> model
(** Show a file read from disk, in a new tab. A file that is already open is
    only brought to the front, keeping whatever has been typed into it: reading
    it again would throw those edits away. *)

val open_new_file : model -> path:string -> model
(** Show a file that has just been created: empty, and straight in edit mode,
    since it was asked for in order to be written in. *)

val save_active_msg : msg
(** Write the tab on display back to disk, as its own save button does.
    Exposed so that the native menu bar can reach the same behaviour. Does
    nothing when no file is open. *)

val update : model -> msg -> model * msg Vdom.Cmd.t

val view : model -> msg Vdom.vdom
