(* The content pane, as a self-contained vdom component: its own model, its own
   messages, its own update, and no knowledge of the application around it.
   app.ml embeds it with [Vdom.map] and [Vdom.Cmd.map], which is how ocaml-vdom
   nests a child into a parent — the child speaks its own message type and the
   parent wraps it on the way up.

   It holds several files at once. Each one is a [tab] carrying its own
   contents, its own view/edit mode and its own save status; the strip along
   the top switches between them. Nothing is shared between two tabs, so a save
   in flight on one cannot land on another. *)
