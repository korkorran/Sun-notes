.SYNOPSIS
Build a distributable Windows installer for Sun notes.

.DESCRIPTION
  packaging\make-installer.ps1 [-Release] [-Version X.Y.Z] [-OutDir DIR]
                               [-NoBuild] [-KeepTree]
                               [-SignToolPath PATH] [-SignArgs "..."]

-Release builds with dune's release profile instead of dev (no dev-only flags,
js_of_ocaml output optimised). Use it for anything you hand to someone else.

Produces dist\Sun-notes-<version>-<arch>-setup.exe, an Inno Setup installer.

This is a PowerShell script, not a bash one like its macOS and Linux siblings,
because it has to drive Windows tools (ISCC.exe, signtool.exe) and PowerShell
is on every Windows machine while bash is not.

Three things are different from every other platform:

  * Nothing resolves dependencies at install time. There is no apt or dnf, so
    any DLL the executable imports and Windows does not ship has to travel
    inside the installer. Here that means the mingw-w64 runtime, which
    owebview pulls in through -lstdc++: libstdc++-6.dll and friends. The
    script reads the import table, copies what it finds, and refuses to build
    if one is missing. (WebView2Loader.dll is not among them — owebview's
    vendored webview.h uses its built-in loader and finds the runtime through
    the registry itself.)

  * WebView2 is not guaranteed to be present. It ships with Windows 11 and
    reaches most Windows 10 machines through Edge, but "most" is not "all",
    and without it the app starts and shows nothing. The installer looks in
    the same registry locations the app will look in at startup and, if the
    runtime is missing, fetches Microsoft's Evergreen bootstrapper first.

  * The executable has no icon of its own. main.ml never calls set_app_icon,
    and on Windows that call would only set the *window* icon anyway — what
    Explorer and the Start menu show comes from an ICO resource inside the
    .exe. The script embeds one with rcedit when it is available, and always
    installs an .ico for the shortcuts to point at, so the shortcuts look
    right either way.

The layout needs no tricks here: Webview.Utils.web_dir looks for a "web"
directory next to the running binary, and on Windows that is simply where it
goes. No symlink, unlike the Linux packages.

[Code]
// The app is a native window wrapped around the system web engine, which on
// Windows is WebView2. Windows 11 has it; Windows 10 usually got it with Edge,
// but not always, and when it is missing the window comes up empty with no
// error at all. So: look for it, and fetch Microsoft's Evergreen bootstrapper
// if it is not there.
//
// The checks below mirror what the app itself does at startup. owebview's
// vendored webview.h (find_installed_client) reads the EBWebView value under
// ClientState\<stable channel guid>, in the 32-bit registry view, per-machine
// first and then per-user — and that same GUID is a constant in that header.
// Checking the very same places is what keeps "the installer said it was
// there" from ever disagreeing with "the window came up empty".
//
// The Clients\<guid>\pv value is Microsoft's documented check, kept as a
// second opinion: every WebView2 installer writes it.
